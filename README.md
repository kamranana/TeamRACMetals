# ChrisRossAnaProject
This is our first team project for CU Full Stack Development between Chris Joo, Ana Kamran &amp; Ross Tauchert

## Project Description

As a Jewelry Store Owner, we want to display the price of precious metals (like gold & silver) on our store page, as well as offer Google Maps capability so potential clients can find our store locations.  We also want to integrate with YouTube to display promotional videos and offers.  This will be achieved by the use of server-side APIs & a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

GIVEN I am a Jewelry Store Shop Owner
WHEN I open the website
THEN the current price of Gold & Silver displays
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with promotional ads via YouTube
WHEN I scroll down further
THEN i am presented with google maps identifying the location of our stores
