# ChrisRossAnaProject
This is our first team project for CU Full Stack Development between Chris Joo, Ana Kamran &amp; Ross Tauchert

## Project Description

As a Jewelry Consumer, we want to display the current price of gold on our website, offer promotional videos via YouTube, as well as Google Maps capability so potential clients can find jewelry store locations, so that consumers can be informed on prices before entering a shop.  This will be achieved by the use of server-side APIs & a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

GIVEN I am a Jewelry Store Consumer
WHEN I open the website
THEN the current price of Gold displays
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with promotional ads via YouTube
WHEN I scroll down further
THEN i am presented with google maps identifying the location of jewelry stores
